# Classification-Part-2

This notebook follows on from notebook "Classification Part 1"

In this notebook we will use the well-known Iris dataset to build and analyse the performance of multi-class classifiers. We will first consider a **kNN** classifier and analyse the impact of changing the value of k on the resulting decision regions. We will then train a **logistic regression** classifier and will analyse its performance using the **confusion matrix**. Finally, we will implement a **Bayesian approach** with Gaussian class densities.
